I wrote this years prior to the initial commit.  It was a utility that lived in
the context of a larger project.  It was used to resolve DNS lookups and supported 
all RFC compliant record types.

# TODO

* Generally clean this code up, I guess
* Add a fsproj for visual studio users
* 100% test coverage
* Recursive resolution (for DNS servers that do not do it for the client)
